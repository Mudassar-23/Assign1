-> Ques1: C++ Even-Odd Array Separator
Description
This C++ program demonstrates techniques for working with arrays and pointers. It creates an array of random integers, separates them into even and odd elements using pointers, and displays the results.

Features:
Generates a user-specified array of random integers.
Effectively separates even and odd elements using double pointers.
Handles null termination for pointer arrays.
Presents even and odd elements in separate lines.
Allocates and deallocates memory dynamically using new and delete[].

Usage:
The program prompts you for the array size. It then generates random integers within a range (e.g., 1-100) and fills the array. 
The code separates even and odd elements using double pointers and null termination. Finally, it displays the even and odd elements in separate lines.

-> Ques2:  Word Occurrence Counter
Description
This C++ program helps you find the number of times a specific word appears in a given sentence. It takes input for the sentence and the word to search for, and then efficiently counts the occurrences.

Features:
User-friendly interface for entering the sentence and search word.
Utilizes cin.getline for handling sentences with spaces.
Implements a numOfOccurences function for counting word occurrences.
Accounts for case sensitivity when searching for the word.


-> Ques3: Student Course Enrollment Checker
Description
This C++ program helps you verify if a student has studied a specific course. It reads student data (roll number, name, and course codes) from a text file (rollnumber.txt) and checks enrollment based on the provided roll number and course code.

Features:
Loads student data from a text file into a Student struct.
Efficiently checks if the student has studied the specified course using a function.
User-friendly input for student roll number and course code.
Clear output indicating whether the student has studied the course or not.

Usage:
The program prompts you for the student's roll number and the course code.
It then reads the student data from the rollnumber.txt file and checks if that student has studied the specified course.


-> Ques4:  Array Rotation
Description
This C++ program demonstrates dynamic memory allocation and array manipulation techniques. It implements a function to rotate an array by a specified number of positions (k).

Features:
Handles dynamic memory allocation using new for the array.
Efficiently rotates the array elements by k positions.
Provides functions for memory allocation, deallocation, and rotation.
User-friendly input for array size, k value, and array elements.
Clear output displaying the original and rotated arrays.
